## Overview

Workspaces in ChatDash are a way to manage multiple brands or clients under one agency account.
Once you sign up, you will have one workspace by default. You can add more workspaces to manage multiple brands or clients separately.
Each workspace has its own brand settings, custom domain, and color scheme. This allows you to manage multiple brands or clients separately without any confusion.
If you need to manage multiple brands, you can add as many workspaces as you need.
