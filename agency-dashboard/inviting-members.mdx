## Overview

As an agency user in ChatDash, you can invite members to your agency workspace.
This allows you to collaborate with your team members and work together on projects.

The member can have two different roles in the agency workspace:
1. **Editor**: Can create, edit, and delete projects.
2. **Viewer**: Can only view projects and analytics data.
