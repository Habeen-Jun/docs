## Overview

As an agency user in ChatDash, you can manage client dashboard access for your clients. 
This allows you to take over full control on what your clients can see and do within their client dashboard.
You can manage client access by turning on/off specific features and settings for each project assigned to a client.
(This means that you can give different access levels to each project assigned to a client if they have multiple projects!)
