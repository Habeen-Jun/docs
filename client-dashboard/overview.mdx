## Overview

The client dashboard in ChatDash is the central hub for clients to view analytics, conversations, and manage their chatbot projects.
The client can login to the dashboard using the agency's custom domain or the ChatDash default domain.

There are three types of menus in the client dashboard:

1. **Shared Client Menus**:
<Note> We don't use the chatbot builders' APIs to handle Shared Client Menus. </Note>
    - **Analytics**: View Chatbot's metrics (# of messages, token usages, etc).
    - **Conversations**: View conversation history with the chatbot.


2. **Platform Specific Menus**:
<Note> We directly use the chatbot builders' APIs to handle Platform Specific Menus. </Note>
    - **Voiceflow**: FAQ, Tags, Knowledge Base.
    - **OpenAI**: Chat Interface, Knowledge Base, Edit Assistant.


3. **Custom Menus**:
    - **Custom Menus**: Custom menus created by the agency for the client. (embedded iframe)

Shared Client Menus are common for all chatbot platforms managed by ChatDash's messaging architecture. 
**(We don't pull data from the chatbot platform's native analytics dashboard.)**
Therefore, tracking metrics and terminolgy might be different from the platform's native analytics dashboard.
