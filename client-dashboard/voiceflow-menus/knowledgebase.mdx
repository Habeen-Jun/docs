## Overview

Voiceflow Knowledge Base menu in the client dashboard allows clients to view and manage their knowledge base data sources.
ChatDash directly integrate with Voiceflow Knowledge Base API to fetch the knowledge base data sources.
**We don't store any knowledge base data sources in ChatDash.**
This saves agency time and effort in managing the knowledge base for the clients.
