# What is ChatDash?
ChatDash is a `Whitelabel AI Chatbots CRM` for agencies that allows you to build, deploy, and manage chatbots for your clients.
At ChatDash, we're **the bridge that connects ai chatbot agencies with the best chatbot building tools.** Our platform makes your job easier and helps your clients get more from their chatbots, making everyone happy. 
It is designed to help agencies and businesses create and manage chatbots efficiently.

# How we started and why you care about ChatDash?
We were running our AI agency and building chatbots for our clients.
We tried many chatbot builders and realized that there was no single platform that could meet all agencies' needs.

We realized the following problems specific to agencies when building chatbots for clients:

1. Difficult to show chatbot's analytics only relevant to the client.
2. Impossible to give branded chatbot dashboard to the client.
3. Time consuming to back and forth with the client to get the chatbot's knowledge base.
4. Impossible to assign one chatbot to multiple clients and manage their usage and billing separately.
5. If an agency uses multiple chatbot builders, it's difficult to manage all of them in one place.
6. Many chatbot builders' webchat widget is not very customizable.
7. No live agent handoff feature in many chatbot builders.
8. Manually billing the client for chatbot usage is a pain.
9. Most chatbot builders don't have a detailed client access control feature. (e.g. restrict access to knowledge base while allowing access to analytics)
10. Deploying the chatbot to multiple channels is a pain. (e.g. webchat, Facebook Messenger, WhatsApp, etc.)
... and many more.

Sounds familiar?

yeah, we felt the same way.

So we decided to build ChatDash to solve these problems 
and make chatbot development and management easier for agencies
at minimal cost.
